since fileReader is async, can't directly store file contents into a variable :(

reverted back to when text input started working then readded the working fileReader code
however it doesn't store in the global variable outside the function scope
    probably because when it submits, it auto refreshes --> complete reset to empty string again
idk i think i might have to write it to a file then read that
    on event submit --> rewrite to file
        (make sure to check double input)
    every time it refreshes:
        if question file not empty:
            question + answer code

slight issue :(
if the question itself contains quotations or commas --> slight issue :(
--> i'll make one ONLY FOR VOCAB, term to term, probably tab separated values but we'll see

storing fileinput + text input issue might be caused by form submit --> will work on changing to event listener for button click, might make it stop refreshing and resetting the value of the inputs
--> similarly might have to replace the start quizzing / check answer buttons

file input + text input is working, just won't print out the way i want to
starting to write script for start quizzing button
