Self Quizzer for Vocabulary
------
This is my feeble attempt to recreate a Quizlet flashcards-like quizzing tool for vocabulary using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
---
HOW IT WORKS:
--> User is asked to input a set of questions and answers (formatted in a TSV file, with each question & answer separated by tab and each question/answer pair separated by newline)
    --> There is also an option to input as text
--> User can begin quizzing themself on their questions
--> Other options:
    --> Once the user has finished quizzing themself on the first set of questions, they can restart their quiz with the same problemset or quiz themself on only their incorrectly answered questions
    --> These incorrect questions can be reset
